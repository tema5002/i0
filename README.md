# i0
i0 is a minimal init system where task start, status, and
autostart are implemented using directories and shell scripts.
No daemons, no configs, no magic.

## Quick start

```sh
i0 new myapp         # create new task layout
i0 start myapp       # launch it
i0 status myapp      # view state
i0 stop myapp        # disable it
```
it doesn't work yet there is nothing to tell else
